                            |_________________________________________________|
                            `                                 `-[ CMD/Batch ]-`

Microsoft Windows Vista and newer introduced a installation infrastructure named
Component-Based Servicing (CBS) whereby patches/updates are included within a
single package, formally dubbed Microsoft Update Standalone Package.  For those
interested in the updated files within a patch (e.g. for binary diffing, patch
patch analysis), the pre-Vista hotfix extraction methods (i.e. "/x", "/extract")
will no longer suffice.  To assist a script has been created to automate the
process of extracting standalone updates.

MSU Expander batch script was created to automate the process of extracting 
multiple MSU patch files using the Expansion Utility. Typically one would need 
to use expand to extract the CAB file, then from that CAB file extract the 
desired file.  This batch script does the tedious tasks associated with the 
process so more time can be spent examining patched files rather than 
extracting/expanding them.

The batch script will:
1) Determine if expand.exe exists and it is 6.x or higher.
2) Initialize and parse command line arguments.
3) Loop through the file names (i.e. matching source specification)
   in the current working directory.
4) Determine the CAB file name within the MSU file.
5) Create any needed output directories using the original file name.
6) Expand the CAB file from the MSU file.
7) Expand from the CAB file any of the desired user-specified files.
8) Delete the CAB file, and repeat if there are more MSU files.

Troubleshooting?  (Remember...this is a BATCH FILE).
Redirect the output to stderr, 2> err.txt
